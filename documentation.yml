Especificação:
Switch are also containeres:
    IP (Optional):
        Definition: 
            - List of IP and mask. It defines the IP addresses of the switch L3 and the subnets to which it belongs to
        Restrictions:
            - If the IP and routing_table are not defined, the switch will have L2 functions
            - It is possible to define the IP and not the routing table, therefore the routing table will only contain the entry for those IP the switch holds
            - If the IP does not correpond to the subnet of the hosts to which it is connected, must raise a warning (the network will not work properly)
    Gateway (Optional if L3 switch):
        Definition:
            - IP of the gateway, the name of any other switch or host or "internet" (gateway is the host's gateway interface)
        Restrictions:
            - If the switch L3 wants to have connection to the world, set gateway with the IP of the interface of the host that has connection to the internet or put "internet"
            - IF the switch is L3, then it must define a gatewawy
    controller_port:
        Definition:
            - The port in which the controller is listening to
    controller_ip:
        Definition:
            - The IP address in which the controller is listening to

Controller:
    image (only if the controller is not on localhost):
        Definition:
            - Instantiate a Docker container that has installed and configured the controller inside the container
    controller_port:
        Definition:
            - The port in which the controller is listening to
    controller_ip:
        Definition:
            - The IP address in which the controller is listening to
    copy_file  (param enabled only if the controller is not on localhost; optional):
        Definition:
            - Copy a local_file inside the container right after instantiating it
    instantiate (param enabled for instantiating localhost controller):
        Definition:
            - Is a list of strings containing the instructions to be executed by command line to instantiate the controller on host's machine
            - Define a default configuration
    run (param enabled only if the controller is not on localhost; optional): 
        Definition:
            - Is a list of instructions to be executed inside the container after instantiating and copy_file (e.g. "docker exec -it container_name sh -c "cd home"")

Host:
    Gateway (Optional if it has only one connection):
        Definition:
            - IP of the gateway, the name of any other switch or host or "internet" (gateway is the host's gateway interface)
        Restrictions:
            - The gateway of hosts are the ip of the first hop by default
            - Gateway param is optional
            - Gateway parameters are available only on "container" e "switch"
    image:
        Definition:
            - The name of a local image on docker container or a image:version of an image from Dockerhub
        Restrictions:
    IP:
        Definition:
            - List of IP and mask. It defines the IP addresses of the switch L3 and the subnets to which it belongs to
        Restrictions:
    DNS (Optional):
        Definition:
            - The IP address of the DNS server
        Restrictions:
            - By default the DNS server is the "8.8.8.8"
    depends_on (Optional):
        Definition:
            - 
        Restrictions:
    copy_file  (optional):
        Definition:
            - Copy a local_file inside the container right after instantiating it
    run (optional): 
        Definition:
            - Is a list of instructions to be executed inside the container after instantiating and copy_file
